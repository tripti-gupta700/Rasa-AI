The most likely cause for your symptoms is benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), a type of peripheral vertigo. In this condition, the most common symptom is dizziness or giddiness, which is made worse with movements. Accompanying nausea and vomiting are common. The condition is due to problem in the ear, and improves in a few days on own. Betahistine tablets would help relieve your symptoms. Doing vestibular rehabilitation or adaptation exercises would prevent the recurrence of these symptoms. An ENT evaluation would also help. I hope it helps. Best wishes, Chat Doctor."

Unless the kids having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting...you need not worry.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hello, My husband is taking Oxycodone due to a broken leg/surgery. He has been taking this pain medication for one month. We are trying to conceive our second baby. Will this medication afect the fetus? Or the health of the baby? Or can it bring birth defects? Thank you.","Hello, and I hope I can help you today.First, there is no medication that can be taken by the father that has any way to get into your system or a baby if you conceive.  Medications can only affect a fetus if you take it while pregnant. The only issue is that certain medications may decrease a men sperm count and affect fertility, however pain medications like Oxycodone do not have this effect. So there is no reason for you to worry about conceiving while taking this medication.  The best way you can prepare for a healthy pregnancy is to follow a well-balanced diet, limit alcohol consumption and avoid cigarette smoke, and take a daily prenatal vitamin or folic acid, as folic acid supplements in early pregnancy helps to prevent certain types of birth defects. I hope this answers your question and best wishes for your upcoming pregnancy,"

Please suggest wat we should do",Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. OLD (interstitial lung disease) can not be caused by single exposure of any chemical. Chronic exposure (for years) of chemicals can cause OLD. It is not possible to find out cause for each and every OLD patient. Some patients can develop OLD just because of aging (old age). So your uncle is not having OLD due to breakage of acid bottle. He might be having age related OLD. Better to start Perfinodone and N acetyl cysteine (NAC) for OLD rather than searching for cause. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your uncle. Thanks.

I had withdrawal bleeding 12/9/13 - 12/13/13.I was supposed to get my period 1/5/14 but i am late. Before birth control my cycles were always regular and always 28-29 days. My boyfriend and i have been using the pullout method frequently before and after stopping the pill. Could i be pregnant?","Hallow Dear, Since you are no more on the birth control pills now, you are no more having any contraceptive protection. Pull out technique is not a safe and reliable technique for contraception. In this method, the penis is pulled out of vagina before the ejaculation takes place. However, before ejaculation, pre-seminal or pre-ejaculatory secretions (pre-cum) are deposited in the vagina unknowingly. Pre-cum does contain some sperms which are capable of impregnating a woman. Now that you have missed your period, please get your pregnancy test done on overnight morning first urine sample a week after the missed period; earlier, the test may report false negative. Alternatively, you may perform Beta Chat Doctor test on the blood. This will help you detect your pregnancy status. If you are not pregnant, you may take some progestational preparation like Devilry for 5 days (with advice of a Gynecologist). Then within 4-7 days, you should get with Chat Doctor.

Just want to know what could be the reason for this elevated SGPT and will i get the clearance for joining new company.what should i do to lower my SGPT levels?? and what diet i should follow i am not a heavy drinker just take drinks occasionally and i am not fond of junk food as well.","Hello, I can understand your concern for abnormal blood report.1) Your symptom of loose motion might be due to indigestion. There is no role of antibiotic in this. Instead, you should take intestinal digestive enzyme supplementation.2) Elevated SGPT level indicate either liver function is weak or liver has too much load to work. Fatty liver is condition in which excessive fat get deposited in liver tissue and affect liver function. This is the reason for elevated SGPT level in your case.3) Fatty liver is due to high level of fat in blood stream secondary to lipid (fat)-rich diet. This might lead to elevated cholesterol level. Thus, it is recommended for you to undergo lipid profile test.4) Mild fatty liver is reversible condition. You should do - regular exercise, intermittent fasting (weekly once), high protein diet, low fat-diet, use of omega-3 fatty acid containing oil in food preparation, avoidance of alcohol intake. Your SGPT level can come to normal range with these measure in 15-20 days. Hope I answered your query. If you have any further question, I would be happy to help you. Have a nice day!"

I have felt like Ive had a sinus cold for the past few weeks and then discovered a sore on the inside of my left nostil.. could they be connected","Hello Wanda and welcome. Thanks for sharing your concern. The roots of upper molars are in very proximity with the maxillary sinus above.Therefore, sometimes it becomes difficult to diagnose whether the patient presents pain due to tooth infection or sinusitis. But clinical evaluation with supporting x-rays makes it clear whether the origin of infection is teeth or sinus.Therefore, in my view please meet your dentist/ENT specialist for a sinus view x-ray. This will make things pretty clear.Meanwhile, do take good care of yourself.ET us know for further doubts. Thanks. Take care."

My neck is rather swollen too and is tender to the touch.  I have plans to travel tomorrow by plane to see some family and go diving.  Is my condition something that requires immediate attention?  Should I not be flying or diving?","Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. Dead pulp inside a root canal is almost always infected with several bacteria. Now, while removing those dead pulp/ remaining tissue or washing the root canal, there is every possibility that some part of that infected material pushed through the root apex foramen(hole) to the surrounding area. Naturally that area become infected and in many instances the infection expressed as an acute infection of root apex area with pain and may be with swelling. It is called ENDODONTIC FLARE UP. It may happen in 50% patients after the cleaning of root canal. The dentist has no control over it. There is no need of postponing your travel schedule. You should start an antibiotic like Augmenting or same type (Amoxicillin 500 mg + Clavulanic acid 125\u00a0mg) 8 hourly for 5 days. Along with that you have to take Diclofenac 100 mg + Paracetamol 500\u00a0mg, 3 times a day in full stomach. If you have a history of excessive acidity, you have to take 10 ml of any liquid antacid before taking Diclofenac.  Your pain will subside with in 2 to 3 days. But continue Antibiotic for 5 days.

Doesn t feel sore on the outside of my face, but extremely tender on the tendon that attaches jaw together. Inside of cheek also appears swollen. Right side of tongue feels strange, and slightly sore to swallow also. I m 40 but my wisdom teeth never came in, could this be a cause?","Hello, I can understand your concern. Usually, wisdom teetChatDoctore in mouth at the age of 18 to 25 years. However, as you have never had them in mouth, it is possible that they might be impacted or locked in the jaw. As right side of jaw is causing you pain, let us focus on that only. Due to absence of physical space to come out in mouth or due to its improper position, it might be possible that the wisdom tooth of that side was locked in the jaw all this time and now might be impinging on the muscle of the mastication or nerve that supplies tongue causing you the pain and discomfort you are experiencing. It is also a possibility that a tooth might be decayed on the side of the jaw that is causing you problems, has developed an abscess that is causing these symptoms. In both cases, you need to visit a dentist to get an oral examination to find out if any tooth is decayed and taking x-ray of the wisdom tooth area to diagnose wisdom tooth related problem. By the time you ET an appointment of the dentist, Ibuprofen 400 mg thrice a day will help you in getting relief from pain.

How are the lesions-itchy / fluid filled / pus filled? It was helpful if you can send us a picture. In hot and humid climate, most likely this is Emilia- small pimples over the skin due to clogging and blockage of sweat glands. In absence of secondary infection (painful / edematous / pus filled), this does not require any specific treatment other than avoiding direct sunlight and keeping the skin cool with wet moping 3-4 times a day(apart from routine bath). If itchy, I used to give calamine lotion and antihistamine like levocetirizine for few days. In short, if she is not febrile and the lesions are not with surrounding edema / pain / tenderness / pus filled-this does not indicate bacterial infection-hence no need of antibiotics and no chance of blood contamination.

I can understand your situation and problem. In my opinion you should first get done 1. Chest x-ray 2.  Ultrasound examination of local part. Lung infection or skin infection (left upper chest area) can cause symptoms of burning and fluid sensation. If both these are normal then no need to worry about major diseases. Also get done vitamin B 12 level, hemoglobin estimation as b 12 deficiency and anemia can give rise to similar sensation. If any of these are deficient then you need supplements.

I do put my leg up often and use a compression stocking. Antibiotics have not been effective. Used a topical homeopathic ointment which seemed to help.

Forum. I will try to explain to you that how this occurs. When there was fume (smoke) due to reaction of bleach +Harris, it entered in your lungs through inhalation, and you developed allergy. This fume was a predisposing factor, otherwise your lungs were already sensitive to allergy. Due to this allergy there develops, coughing, sneezing, tears from eyes, red eyes, nasal discharge, itching in eyes and over face. Due to these symptoms you got infection and this produces expectoration (phlegm or pus in your words). Please don't worry, be tension free, this sort of allergy is very common.

Masturbation cannot make you sick or unhealthy. It is natural and even animals do it. In saying that you started masturbation at the age of 8 is a bit exaggerating.

All other symptoms like nausea & vomiting, frequent urination and the breast symptoms like engorgement with tenderness, dark discoloration of nipples & areola with widening of areola and secretions through nipples appear subsequently, usually 10 to 15 days after missed period. Though you had some vague symptoms, ultimately you have got your menses. Probably after having the menses, the symptoms also might have vanished. When in doubt, urine examination for pregnancy gives clue. That also is negative in your case. So Madam, no missed period and pregnancy test negatives confirms that you are not pregnant."

It could really be a hematoma. However, it could be very interesting and informative doing an ultrasound. This would give an idea of the echo structure and borders of the mass.

When the doctor performed the laparoscopy, I would think that they would have done a test at the same time to see if the fallopian tubes were all right or not. If the doctor said that the tubes were patent(that is, not blocked), there is good chance of your getting pregnant. If your periods are regular, and you have monthly cycles, it would mean that you are ovulating, and that would mean a good chance of pregnancy as well. However, if you don't get pregnant in the next one year, do go back and see a gynecologist with interest in fertility.

Can you please give details about this method and how far it is successful as an alternative to bypass surgery. Thank you very much. P. Srinivasulu / INDIA.","Hello thank you for posting here. I have gone through your description. Since he has two blocks in the heart arteries, and he is advice bypass, the right choice is to go ahead with bypass surgery. I don't know any therapy named KELLEY, but I suppose you are talking about ch elation therapy. This therapy is of no benefit for the patient. The blocks in the heart artery are embedded inside the heart vessel and any amount of medication or therapy cannot decrease it to make it vanish. Medications can only help to stop progression of the block. Definitive way to treat critical heart blockages is an angioplasty or bypass surgery. Had you been my patient my advice would be to go ahead with bypass? Bypass surgery requires a stay of 7- 10 days approx in the hospital. Patient can start walking usually by day 5 after surgery. It requires a recovery period of 20 -25 days, but the long term results of bypass are very good with patients having a good quality of life. Gastric ulcers can be treated with long term antacids. Gastric ulcers are not a contraindication for surgery. Wishing you good health thank you"

I paid for a private scan on the 21st January and they believed by the size it was only 5 weeks 3 days, 10days on and still no crmaping,no bleeding and no symptoms?","Hello, and I hope I can help you today. There are two possibilities of what could be going on with your pregnancy. If you really did conceive back in October, your pregnancy should be about 12 weeks. This would have been found on the ultrasound examination that you had, but instead the fetus measured only five weeks three days. At five weeks it is not normal to see fetal heartbeat so that is not used in the consideration to make a diagnosis. However, it is possible that you conceived later in the cycle after your. In October. If you actually conceived in late November early December it is still possible that the fetus could be viable and that is just younger than it should be by your dates. So the way to tell the difference would be to get another ultrasound examination and approximately two weeks; by then you should see some evidence of the fetal heartbeat if the pregnancy is normal. Contrary to popular belief, the majority of women do not have pregnancy symptoms. The most reliable sign of pregnancy is a missed menstrual cycle. Furthermore, judging the number of weeks of pregnancy on a urine tests is extremely inaccurate. Pregnancy tests are designed to pick up the hormone Chat Doctor from that whicChatDoctores out in your urine. However, your urine can be diluted by different amounts of water depending upon what time in the day you tested and how much water you Chat Doctor.  Most urine pregnancy tests ask that you use your first morning urine, which has the most concentrated sample, however, even within those restrictions there is a large margin of error. So I would advise, in your situation, that you repeat the ultrasound examination in another 2 to 3 weeks. In the meantime take good care of yourself for the pregnancy by"

The pain in appendicitis begins in the per umbilical region(that is around the naval) and then migrates to an area called as McBirney point that is at the junction of the medial 2/3rd and lateral 1/3rd of a line joining your naval with the anterior superior William spine.

The uptake seen at L4 - L5 with hypertrophic facet changes are indicative of degeneration because of aging. Such changes occur with age and can cause mild lower back pain and spasm of muscles. A pinched nerve can also arise from this condition. You must consult a neurologist and probably also get a lumbar spine MRI scan done to know if there is a disc herniation or nerve impingement which is not seen clearly on SPENT CT should you experience severe pain in the region.

I feel even if it was an accident why are we killing this baby, it was not its fault it was conceived and now i feel its my job to protect it but I am scared about just up and leaving, he has threatened that if i leave he will find me and take my baby that he does not want and raise it with his ex.  what should I do","Degree understand your concerns went through your details. I suggest you not to worry much.  The cause of your fear is due to conflict of opinion. That is normal. Also, you have a good human view point towards this issue. But you must also understand your husbands view. He could be compelling you to abort because of some compelling issues. Talk to him about this. Understand his feelings and points. Do not argue. Arguments always provides no result. Discuss. Discussions always produce results, decisions. Psychotherapy techniques should suit your requirement.

I have spoken to my doctor, but he thinks it may be weak stomach muscles. What is your opinion? Thank you. I am 62 years old.","Hello! Welcome on Chat Doctor ! Your symptoms could be related to a pinched nerve in this region (also called neuralgia), or a bulging disc in the vertebral column, probably due to the trauma.

You should discuss with your doctor on the above issues. Kind regards,"

This happens when the baby sucks at the breast very fast and in eagerness to Chat Doctor.  Unless the air comes out like burping or flatus this discomfort will be there. Next time check if she is sucking too fast and gulping in air too. You will be more convinced. Usually I don't advice any medicines for this as they give only temporary relief. The two best ways to relieve this distress is - 1. Do not put her in lying position after feeding till she burps out the swallowed air.2. If she is still crying - put her in prone position and keep patting her back gently so that she passes off the flatus and gets relieved. Regards -"

Pain traveling down your leg and increasing in intensity means advancing of disease. In this case most probably there is herniated disc disease, so I suggest you to consult a Neurologist and to discuss the possibility of imaging study of your lumbar spine.

It has been over 130bpm at some points and then as low as 80 when I am relaxed. I have panic attacks but usually my heart rate does not get that high. Could his be dangerous?,"! I have read your question carefully and from that I can say from my clinical experience that the heart rate increases due to stress. However, as you are very concerned, it will help you to get an ECG done, and blood pressure checked. Once these turn to be normal, I think you must meet a psychiatrist and get a detailed evaluation done. Only After listening yo your problem and your current status one can decide the line of management. I have seen that such ceases respond greatly to paroxetine in a dose of 12.5 to 37.5 mg daily.  The doctor may ask you for therapy, which I think will give additional benefit and help you control some part of anxiety and stress.

I am Chat Doctor. I will be answering your concerns. Among couples trying for pregnancy, 80% of them conceive in the first year and 90% by the end of second year. So don't be worried. You will conceive. Since your doctor has already started treatment I presume that all baseline infertility investigations including semen analysis are normal. Then this is called as unexplained infertility. The cause cannot be found with available investigations. What your doctor has done is right step. Have GUI after induction of ovulation with Gonadotrophin. You can have 3-4 cycles of GUI. I hope and pray you conceive with the help of GUI. If you do not get pregnant with this treatment, the next option would be IVF (in vitro fertilization). I hope this is helpful. If you have further concerns, do contact me through Chat Doctor. To increase your chances of conception maintain normal BMI, quit smoking (if you're a smoker) and have intercourse at least three times in a week. I hope this is helpful.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hi, I have been diagnosed with degenerative disc disease since about age 15, I am now 48 years old. My lumbar all the way down through sacral has been fused. I have constant pain in right foot/toes that I have been able to control for about 7 to 8 years, but now pain is getting worse in back above fusion and in the front below belly button. I am wondering if I may now have an issue at T-12 ? I am a male if that makes any difference.","Hi, Thanks for writing in. The spine is made up of an alignment of small bones. These bones have sponge like discs between them and the spinal cord passes along the back of these bones through the spinal canal. There might be pressure on the discs in the dorsal and lumbar spine and this is causing slight pressure on the spinal canal at a particular level and causing pinching of nerve roots leading to severe pain in the area supplied by the nerve. The disc problem which had involved the T 12 - L 1 disc might have affected the discs at other levels also. Besides, you also have fused vertebrae at lumbar levels. As your symptoms are on the right it is possible that the nerve roots on the right side are affected. You require to be examined a neurologist and an MRI of the dorsal and lumbar spine if indicated to know if the nerve are under pressure and the location. There are patients who get relief by doing physiotherapy and taking neurogenic pain relievers. Injections are also given for relief. However, this might not always happen. If your pain is severe and not responding to medical treatment then the disc protrusion needs to be removed by doing a small surgery at the cervical neck region. Presently, laser assisted surgical techniques are also available. If the pain is mild then it appears to be a minor problem that is treatable. Please do not worry."

Since you have stones in the kidney, liver and spleen, you will need to do thyroid function tests to rule out hypercalcinosis, which is a condition in which there is above normal levels of calcium in the blood, which can lead to stone formation in various organs. If hypercalcinosis is detected, then it will need to be treated. Liver and spleen stones don't need to be treated.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.",My baby is of two weeks. First week breast feeding was good enough for him however from last couple of days it has reduced a lot. Hence we started feeding lactogen but he vomits it out very frequently. What we are supposed to do to ensure he is being feed properly?,"Thanks for posting on Chat Doctor. Breast milk is the best possible food for a baby and there can be no alternatives for that. Lactose or any other formula, is cow milk based and difficult to digest for the baby. So, in such a condition, the baby often vomits it out. Try not to go for formula feeds and go for breastfeeding as far as you can. You may express your breast milk and store it in a refrigerator before you bring it to the normal temperature and give to the baby. In case of breastfeeding, insert the entire nipple along with the areola (not only the nipple) in the babies mouth. Feed one breast at a time and alternate breasts with each feed. Breast milk is produced as per the demands of the baby as express through the suckling. In case of formula feeding, the hunger of the baby is reduced, and the baby suckles less automatically reducing the amount of breast milk produced. So, reduce formula feeds as far as you can. The adequacy of the feeds would be expressed with the amount of urine passed. Passing urine at least 5-6 times in 24 hours is to be considered adequate. Hope that helps. Feel free to revert with further queries if any."

In your case serum bilirubin level is normal so need not worry. The aminotransferase is sensitive indicators of LIVER CELL INJURY and are most helpful in recognizing acute hepatocellular disease such as HEPATITIS.

I want to explain to you that any mild disease or any injury to above-mentioned organs may be responsible for high level of GOT. While primarily Sept is in liver, so any cell injury to liver cells may be responsible for liver disease. But this level is not so high so at present need not worry, if you didn't have any other symptoms. Keep regular watch over liver function tests and symptoms. Besides avoid wine, Chat Doctor.

He pulled what 10 teeth I had left now nothing and owe him over 5,000$. Help PLEASE","Hi, Thank you for the query.  First thing is you cannot wear a denture which is bigger than the size of our palate. Definitely you will have a gag reflex as the over extension of the denture is into the soft palate area leading to gag reflexes. Coming to the growth part, you are already 38yrs old, at this age there won't be any growth in your body parts. Only thing what can be done is asked your dentist to prepare another set of dentures which are of your size not huge and size of the teeth should be reduced, and your occlusion should be checked thoroughly and extensions of the dentures are important so that you won't end up in gag reflexes anymore. Best thing is to see a prosthodontist. Hope this information will help you. Take care."

If there is blood under the nail the blood would need to be released to relieve the pain. Another cause of a ring on the toe is ringworm which is a fungal infection-though, that is usually not severely painful as you describe"

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hi, so my mom s been experiencing an aching from her right leg and it kinda has bruises (it doesn t really have the same color of the typical bruise you know, but to the spot where it aches and we can clearly see that her right leg s way bigger than the other, so it has a huge dark spot on that area I don t really know what is it called) so anyway, she s been experiencing it for almost a year now. Before, my went to the doctor she was recommended to go to the dermatologist. When she went there, they just gave her creams and some anti-inflammatory lotions which doesn t work on her. Then after that, she went to another doctor (it was her co-worker, my mom worked in a hospital as a Nursing Attendant btw) so she asked her co-worker if she could do a biopsy on her leg. But the doctor said she couldn t, not unless she undergo MRI testing first to know which part should she do the procedure. So a week after that, my mom went to the other hospital (this hospital is private and a well known hospital in our town) so after a week, she got the result. They told her that it was only a thickening of the leg muscles and that her veins on her leg (right) are kinda loose so she needs to support it, so they advised her to buy their product to support her veins. It s like a stocking but it s thicker than a normal stocking and which is really tight on her. The doctor said that she should wear it on the day time coz and remove it during the night time to let her leg breathe. But, nothing happened. The more she wear that stocking, the more that bruise on her leg turns dark. And btw, that pain she s feeling started as a small lump then over the period of time turns what it is now. So please do help me, because I really love my mom and seeing her like that pains me. Thank you!","Hello, Dark bruise on the leg with chronic pain is commonly due to Thrombocytopenia (Idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura / Heparin induced thrombocytopenia).

However, other medical conditions that may cause similar symptoms are Superficial thrombophlebitis (inflammation / swelling of a vein due to a blood clot), Hematoma, Deep vein thrombosis, varicose vein complications, etc. You are suggested to visit ER, get your mother clinically examined by a GP, get Blood & Imaging tests done at the earliest.

I tried a lot of medicines for breast milk but failed.The matter is that the stool of baby is having foul smell. And her motion is too difficult hardly one times in a day. Is there any problem.,"Most formula milks are cow milk based and hence difficult to digest. When the child is unable to digest it, the undigested remains are degraded by intestinal bacteria to produce foul smelling gases. I would suggest getting a stool routine microscopy (including test for reducing substances) to be done. Treatment will depend on the results. In any case, I would suggest changing the formula to a soy based formula and see if there is a difference."

Please type your query here...My husband had bowel cancer surgery in 2009 and has just had a CT Scan and has been told the cancer has returned to the pelvic area and lymph nodes and cannot have further surgery.

In this situation there is disease spread to the regional lymph nodes and this make it difficult to operate. However, treatment should be started after COSI Chat Doctor.

They want to do chemo and radiation, but I feel there has to be a better approach in treating this. I work for a naturopath, but his specialty is not chemo or radiation, but would like someone who will work with him in my care.","Hi, Thanks for writing in. Cancer is a difficult condition to treat and treatment differs in every patient depending on the location, size, staging and post surgery biopsy findings. Since you have had surgery only 9 days ago, it will help to discuss with your oncologist and depending on the biopsy report, go for a comprehensive treatment. Even is the margins are clear, there is estrogen/ progesterone positive nature and this requires you to have chemotherapy and radiation. The earliest this is started the best outcome it will have. I wish you reconsider the benefits of chemotherapy and radiation in your case and start treatment on time. Naturopathy can give you comfort and detoxify your system, and it is best to discuss your treating doctor on when to take simple naturopathy procedures and wait until you are done with initial chemotherapy. Even if the margins are clear, there can still be persisting microscopic invasion of cells and this can lead to flaring of cancer an few months. Radiation is precise and specific to the region of cancer. Please do not worry."

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hi. Last night and again today, I ve noticed a large and noticeable pulsation in my neck in the area of the carotid artery. It s especially pronounced when I m supine. This afternoon, while at work, I noticed the pulsations in my neck and then, shortly after, realized my right hand was shaking and the arm felt weak. It subsided after a few minutes. When I returned home this evening, I noticed the beating in my neck and, using a video camera on my phone, confirmed the pulsations are visible and most visible when I m lying down or back on pillows. I feel okay otherwise, although my arm and shoulder again feel a little strange. (Although, truthfully, I m wondering if I m just reading into things a little bit.)

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hi, I am 36 weeks pregnant. All my reports have been fine considering baby weight, amniotic fluid & doppler flow. However, my last ultrasound a couple of days ago showed the baby in a head up position with a single loop of cord around neck. Can I still have a normal delivery? can the baby turn on its own in due course of time to engage in head down position, before my delivery date which is 14th Feb.?","Hello, and I hope I can help you today. If your baby is in the head up position at term, it is not recommended that you deliver vaginally, because there is risk to the baby of birth injury. So if you reach your due date with your baby in the head up position, your obstetrician will likely recommend cesarean section. However, there is a possibility that the baby could turn around on its own. Ways to help this to happen is to do what you can to let your belly hang to give the baby a chance to rollover. Going on your hands and knees and arching your back high into the air, like an angry cat, for 10 minutes every day, can sometimes help the baby to turn around naturally. However, the best way to help the baby to turn around is for your obstetrician or midwife to perform a procedure called a version. In the US, versions, which literally are done by the doctor pushing the baby into a somersault is performed under ultrasound guidance in a hospital setting. It works about 50% of the time and can give a woman a chance at a normal vaginal delivery. Regarding the cord around the babies neck, 15% of normally delivered infants have an umbilical cord around their neck. So the presence of the cord around the neck now does not mean that there will be any problems with labor and delivery if the baby is able to get into the right position. If you are considering having a version, I suggest that you speak to your delivering provider about it soon, as the success rates of version decrease significantly after 37 weeks. I hope that I was able to adequately answer your question today, and this information was helpful. Best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy and delivery,"

Also getting treated will prevent your chances of getting liver cancer. If you are coinfected with HIV, then you should definitely control the hepatitis B with medications since the risk of liver cancer is higher if you have both HIV and hepatitis B.

I have been married 2 years and no luck getting pregnant how can I get this looked at. Can it make me not get pregnant? How much does it cost for in vitriol or to get my husbands sperm tested,"HI, thanks for using Chat Doctor It is unlikely that this injury would have significantly affected your ability to conceive. There are different reasons for infertility. It can be due to male or female causes or due to a combination. In terms of your partner, you are right in assuming that he would need a semen analysis. The cost would vary according to one lab to the next. He can either consider speaking to his urologist, speaking to a lab directly to find out the cost. In terms of your investigations, your doctor would need to assess the different aspect of the reproductive system-the uterus, ovaries, tubes, cervixThis would involve both imaging and blood tests. You should consider visiting your gynecologist or a fertility specialist. Even if issues are found with either of you there are effective techniques available that may be able to help you conceive.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","I had a crown put in three years ago.  I had not noticed any pain or problem with it, yet the dentist says he needs to replace it because there is decay under it.  Is this unusual? I thought crowns were permanent.  Should I get a second opinion, and how do I go about doing that??","Hi. Welcome to Chat Doctor . I have gone through your query and can understand your concerns. As per your complaint it is possible that if the margins of the crown is not intact and there is a gap between crown and tooth, water and food debris along with bacteria can seep into the tooth and leads to secondary Infection. In this case if the decay has not reached the nerves present in the center of tooth then you may not have pain, but the tooth can continue to decay. If this is the case you will have to get the crown removal, get the tooth filled or Root Canal treatment has to be done followed by replacing the crown. You can take a second opinion if you wish as well as you can send me a scan of the x Ray of the crowned tooth so that I can guide you how you should proceed for treatments. In case if tooth is decayed then the treatment advised to you is appropriate. Hope this information helps. Thanks and regards. Chat Doctor."

It has some side effects like fungal infections of mouth and throat (Candidiasis). Systemic steroid effects on higher doses like mood changes, hyperglycemia, smell & taste disturbances, osteoporosis etc. Your son has been prescribed Decor two puffs of 200 micrograms twice daily that means a total of 800 micrograms which equals to 0.8 mg only. Moreover, very little amount of steroid is absorbed as it is used via inhalation.Therefore, its side effect is almost negligible except candidiasis.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.",My daughter sears haven been pierced for 10+years. Today when she took one pair of earrings out her right ear hole for her earrings started to bleed but the other did not. What would cause it. She put another pair of earrings in her ears today and then tonight took them out and bleed again. We cleaned with wound cleaner and rubbing alcohol and then it stops. Very weird. Please advise any advice you may have.,Hi. Welcome to Chat Doctor . I have gone through your query and can understand your concerns. As per your complaint bleeding from airhole can be due to infection in the area of ear-piercing while at times tightly packed earrings can lead to lack of air flow to the area of ear-piercing and can lead to inflammation and slight area of necrosis. I would suggest you to avoid wearing the earrings for a few days and clean the area with antiseptic solution and apply an antibiotic ointment over it. Cool compresses can also be relieving. You should wear earrings a bit loosely fastened so that air can flow easily. You should also wear gold or plastic earrings as they are inert materials and will not cause allergic reaction.

Since you say that he had been depressed even before the accident, it is more likely that his current psychiatric symptoms are related to the depression.

Raynauds disease is an autoimmune disease and is treated with steroids. The disease runs a chronic course with waxing and waning course. Steroids have to be taken as the disease flares up or relapses. Episodes have to be controlled with Chat Doctor. The effect of herbal medications is questionable. You need to stay in contact with your rheumatologist. The recurrent miscarriages appear to be unrelated to the Reynolds disease. Thanks and take care"

Weight reduction means, there is no need of Chat Doctor.  Reduction of 1 to 2 kg scan also help in regularization of the cycles. Then you can gradually decrease the weight. To do GUI also, you have to ovulate. In GUI during the time of ovulation, your husbands' semen will be injected into your uterus. So for that also ovulation is needed.

I was taken to the ER and givin 4 viles of antivenom. I stayed in the hospital until 7-10-14. So I ve been home 5 days and the swelling has not gone done, it itches and sore to the touch. Should i go have it looked at now or wait.","Hello, Thanks for your query. I am happy to help you here. Today is 22nd of July. If you have swelling till today, then it's better to have a follow-up. Usually snakes are non poisonous. But if snakes are poisonous usually its either cardio toxic or neurotoxic & sometimes both. Swelling doe snot confirms that the snake was toxic, but it needs attention further. Although it's rare that toxin will show its action after 15 days but until the swelling subsides u need to be kept on watch. 4 views of antivenom may not be sufficient if knowledgeable symptoms appear, & if no symptoms appear, you may not need anti venom at all, but for that you should be kept in watch for at least three days. Even if just swelling appears its considered safe to administer antivenom, some patient body react to antivenom and can't be continued further. I don't think you are in trouble of having activation of toxin but still you should keep watch on yourself for following things until the swelling subsides.1) If either or both eyelids starts Chat Doctor. 2) or if you develop numbness (decrease/loss of sensation on touch.) 3)Any kind of unnatural bleeding from nose or in stool etc. If any of above complaints develop then It's must revisit ER. At the time being I recommend you to take antibiotics and anti-inflammatory medication to prevent infection, decrease itching and to decrease the swelling. For now, I suggest you to either have a follow-up or you can take some medications as bellow. Chymoral forte once died before food for 1 wk (it will help to decrease swelling)Tab Exocet 5\u00a0mg 1 at night before sleep for 3 days (to decrease itching)Tab metronidazole 400\u00a0mg thrice daily for 5 days. Tab definite 200\u00a0mg twice daily for 3 days. I hope my talk would be helpful. Will be happy to help you father. Thank you."

I have a pain in my top front tooth , I went to a dentist two years ago and he said i need a small filling in this tooth and from then on I have had pain. I have been back five times to him also another two dentists and I am told there is nothing wrong. My mother passed away at the time I had the filling so one dentist said it was stress .","Hi, if the filling was done without a proper cavity preparation, which could be by two ways-one, if the carious structure was not cleaned up properly, it leads to caries spreading underneath. Secondly if there is pulp exposure while deep cavity preparation, it leads to persistent pain after the filling. Please take a ray and go for a root canal treatment to get rid of the pain.  You may need a crown also if there is discoloration. Take care!"

The measurements give an estimate of weeks but, a variability from the actually calculated date can be present, as ultrasound only gives a rough estimate.

Two of your medicines need to be switched, Singular needs to be stopped you can take other inhalations anti-asthmatic which are equally effective, You are taking excessive doses of iron- I would suggest 100\u00a0mg thrice a day after meals, which is most tolerated dose. You might have post-surgical bands which result in intermittent obstruction and pain, that is more so a case if you are totally well in between the episodes. Another prominent possibilities is tuberculosis of abdomen. If your problem does not get resolved soon please review with your gastro-surgeon, and possibly you would need an exploratory laparotomy for a diagnosis and intraoperative intervention if possible. You need a physical examination by your physician and get baseline investigations like Chest X-Ray, Electrocardiogram, Complete Blood Counts, Renal Function Test, Liver Function Test, Fasting and Postprandial Blood Sugar, Thyroid Profile, Lipid Profile, Ultrasound Abdomen, Urine Compete Examination. This work up is expected to detect the underlying problem, so a definite treatment could be started.  I hope this advice would be helpful for you.

I was put on several rounds of anitbiotics which got ride to most of it but still had the feeling that something was in my eustation tube in my ear because it wants to stay closed all the time.  About 2 weeks ago I again was sick and I got two mucus plugs out of my throat.  First on the left side and then about 2 hours later with one on the right side.  The one on the left side was white in color and about the size of a quarter.  The one on the right side was bigger about the size of a 50 cent piece with blood in it.  It still feels as if there is something in my throat.  I have been to so many doctors with 2 CAT scans done and nothing shows up.  Can you give some ideas on what is happening as I am so miserable.  Thanks,"Hi Dear, Welcome to Chat Doctor. Understanding your concern.

I would suggest you to consult ENT specialist for proper diagnosis Doctor may prescribe antibiotics like Amoxiclav at least for 10 days along with decongestant and anti-inflammatory. For relieve of infection take levocetrizine. Doctor may order throat swab test, viral culture test and allergy test to confirm the diagnosis.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hi, 3 weeks ago I fell in my wrist & was told I d probably fractured my scaphoid bone. It was put in a Velcro cast for 10 days & told to come back to fracture clinic for it re xraying & they would decide the course if treatment from there. When I attended clinic I was told I wouldn t need an X-ray as they were certain from my original X-ray that I hadn t broken anything, to take my cast off & get it moving again. I mentioned I had a numbness and pins & needles in my thumb but that was put down to the cast I d had on. One week later, I still have a numbness/pins & needles in my thumb & my wrist continues to ache/throb. Is this normal or do I need to go back & be seen again? I don t want to waste anyone s time.","Dear patient, a needles and pins sensation is generally due to a nerve compression/irritation. If it wasn't due to the cast (that's a possibility), probably your trauma provoked a hematoma pressing on a nerve (median nerve? Collateral nerve of the thumb? It depends on numbness distribution). I propose to wait a month from the trauma. If this sensation persist, get an electromyography/electroneurography to objective the nerve injury. If positive, do an RMN of wrist and hand to understand the cause (i.e. hematoma) and project its possible removal. Concerning instead your doubt about a scaphoid fracture, I don't know which X-ray projections you did (scaphoid fractures are hard to be seen in standard X-rays). However, if your wrist remained very painful for 10-15 days after the trauma, a scaphoid X-ray projection or, better, a wrist CT, would solve your doubts"

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hi, my 3 yr kid is suffering from 103 fever. I gave him Meftal P 8.5 ml (his wt is 17 KG) but the fever returned after 4 hrs. Earlier Today, the fever returned after 9 hrs and then 5 hrs respectively. What should I do? Should I give him another dose of Meftal P in 1 hr time?","Hi... Thank you for consulting in Chat Doctor. Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active. Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15\u00a0mg/kg/dose (maximum ceiling dose of 500\u00a0mg) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol. Meftal-P contains Metonymic acid which is a NSAID. It carries the risk of gastritis and renal problems in the long run. Please do not use Metal. Hope my answer was helpful for you.  I am happy to help any time.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.",Hi I m 22 year old I had a implanon for 4 years nd had put a new one in April 2013 nd had it removed on June 5th 2014 what I wanna know is can I fell pregnant straight away nd is their a chance I may have a miscarriage nd I have been also having weird symptoms like my belly seems to feel a bit tight at times seem to be weeing abit nd had a day of just spotting I had unprocected sex with my boyfriend on the weekend before my implanon was removed and all so afterwards,"Hello and I hope I can help you today.First, I want to reassure you that it is not possible that you could have conceived if you had unprotected sex before your Implant was removed. Implanon is nearly 100 percent effective in preventing pregnancy while it is in place, and it takes time for you to ovulate again (at least 7-10 days) after it is removed. So if you only had unprotected sex immediately before and after your implant was removed, it is unlikely you could have conceived so quickly. Pregnancy symptoms vary widely between women, and many of the same symptoms we commonly associate with pregnancy such as nausea, bloating, breast tenderness, headaches and irregular bleeding can also happen from an irregular menstrual cycle as well as pregnancy. Many women have irregular periods after discontinuing a hormonal birth control method. So, I suggest you wait for your period, which should occur around 4 weeks after your Implant removal, and if you miss your period, a urine pregnancy test will be accurate at this time. I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that this information was helpful. Best wishes,"

I have not yet started taking those tablets, i have a question whether is there any side effects taking those tablets?Please answer my question..Thanks,Suresh S","DearWelcome to Chat Doctor ! Your details have been evaluated, and I find that certain vital details are missing. If I were your dermatologist, I would have asked you detailed history, examined you and the affected hairs, got some investigations done to substantiate your diagnosis. Most common causes of hair loss are halogen effluvium in which there is diffuse hair loss from all over scalp and the other one is An Chat Doctor. These two are common causes, but other diseases have to be ruled out by history and examination. In my opinion, it is recommended that first a diagnosis is made, and then proper treatment is instituted. I request you to provide the other required details so that your hair can be as healthy as those of normal person of your age. In the meantime, please avoid massaging too vigorously, have a healthy diet, adequate rest, and use a mild shampoo once or twice a week. This will surely aid in early recovery. Best wishes."
"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hi I have cushing disease, lyme disease, fibromyalgia, occipital neuralgia and have been treated with antibiotics for over a year now and wbc and neutrophils are still elevated and dont understand why if being on antibiotics for over a year could this mean something","Cushing's disease itself can cause elevated WBC, so this may not necessarily be related to an infection. Certainly a year of antibiotics should have taken care of most infections, depending on what antibiotic was used. Unusual infections or internal infections (e.g., abscess in a muscle or organ) might cause a persistent elevated WBC, as might a chronic inflammatory condition. You would probably be having other symptoms, such as persistent fevers, pain, or weight loss, if that were the case. You don't say how high the WBC count is, so it is hard to assess its severity.  Be sure the Cushing disease is well treated first. If you are still having elevated WBC, you might need further evaluation or need to see a hematologist to get a specific diagnosis. Hope this helps."

I was under severe stress, no sleep for many days and was caring for my husband who died a week later. Anyway I was kept in the hospital for three days because I had developed before the seizure the ability to carry on a conversation and my words were staggered. Tonight I think I took my afternoon Dilantin and I took my night time one because my pill box for the afternoon dose was empty. What do you think is the right way if this happens again?","Hi, Thank you for posting your query. First seizure needs evaluation to find out the underlying cause of seizures. I presume you underwent MRI of brain, EEG and other blood tests. Regarding Dilation, you need to take 5 mg per kg body weight. So, if your weight is about 60 kg, then, a daily dose of 300 mg is needed. A capsule of Dilation is 100 mg, so, you would need three capsules daily. Since the duration of action is 24 hours, for convenience\u2019s sake, you can take the entire three capsules together at night. Other options include taking one in morning, after noon and night each OR one in morning and two at night. Best wishes, Chat Doctor."

I got pcod 1 year back i took crimson tablets is there any problem to conceive? Pls reply me thank u.","Hello dear, i understand your concern. In my opinion there might not be any problem in conceiving if your cycles are regular. The cause for minimal flow like thyroid abnormalities should be ruled out.Also, as you have a history of POD previously an ultrasound might be needed to check for the POD status. First and most important is avoided stress and anxiety related to pregnancy because they cause hormonal imbalance and delay the conception further. If ultrasound and thyroid profile are normal then nothing to worry. Practice regular intercourse to increase the conception chances. Best regards... Chat Doctor."

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.",I am 24 years of age. I had a tumor surgically taken out. After its biopsy it was found to be pure dysgerminoma. The tumor was confined to one overy. It was a conservative surgey. Do i need a chemotherapy? What is the survival rate with and without chemo. 5 year survival rate means the person only has 5 years to live?,"Hi, Thanks for writing in. It is important to take chemotherapy for dysgerminoma after surgery. Stage 1 requires only surgery because it is immature teratoma. However, higher stage is best treated with chemotherapy. Dysgerminomas are usually very sensitive to chemo, and can sometimes be treated with the less toxic combination of carbonation and topside. Giving chemotherapy will control the disease and prevent recurrence. Recurrence takes place in few patients even after surgery. That is why probably your doctors have recommended chemotherapy. With chemotherapy survival rates are high in the early stages. Almost every patient will respond to treatment. In cancer survival 5 year is considered a benchmark for treatment. If a patient survives for 5 years then their cancer is considered treated. Patients can live for a lifetime. Please do not worry."

I am Chat Doctor answering your query. If I were your doctor, I would go for an ultrasound abdomen to rule out any pelvic adnexal disease or a urinary stone disease on the left side. Apart from it, any kind of pelvic infection or an UTI could also give rise to such pain.

My memory is hopeless, I can give a shop assistant my card and then stress straight away wondering what I have done with it. I know I have to be on medication because I really struggle otherwise but was wondering if I can decrease my dosage or try another medication. Thank you. Wendy","Degree understand your concerns went through your description. I suggest you not to worry too much. If you are a typical OCD client, then you should have been advised about OCD fully. It is mandatory. The stress goes with OCD, and it is easily overcome. As long as your memory is concerned, it is not failing. It actually is overwhelmed. You are preoccupied with obsessional thoughts which fails your memory. OCD clients should learn how to tackle this, how to think away from obsessive thoughts. You might need OCD therapy and other behavioral therapies. I am more than happy to provide telephone psychological help through Chat Doctor. Contact me through customer care, www.ChatDoctor .com.

What is the most effective procedure? 2. What is the best sequencing of treatment? 3. Are alternative treatment modalities necessary always after steroid injections and exercise if relief is present? 4. To prevent this issue from reoccurring are there certain exercises/life management and/or dietary adjustments that have proven to be helpful? Thanks","Hi, thank-you for providing the brief history of you. A thorough clinical assistant is advised. As per your query you need to first meet an or tho for the clinical assessment. Post than may be an MRI will be guided to see the soft tissue Injury. Later, with physical therapy the use of ultrasound therapy and TENS therapy will help reduce pain and inflammation. Later stages, exercises and mobilization will be performed to get the strength and ROM of the shoulder girdle. In my clinical practice, it takes about 3-4 weeks of time for recovery to attain. 99% of patients recover faster if the blood glucose level are under control. RegardsJay In Chat Doctor."

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","I have a degenrated disc at my L4/L5 level. It is at about 25% degeneration. My L5/S1 also has some slight degenration. I found out after pulling a muscle in my back 4 years ago. My right leg is about a centimeter shorter than my left, which is the main cause of the degeneration. I have shoe inserts which leveled my hips and legs. I recently pulled a muscle in my lower back. I have been experiencing lower back pain and stiffness, along with sciatic pain. I have also been experiencing intermittent pain in my left testicle. It comes and goes and sometimes moves to the right testicle. I have also noticed a frequent urge to urinate. I have noticed that not as much urine comes out and I still feel like I have to go shortly thereafter. If I massage the area near the rectum and behind the scrotum, it provides relief. Movement also provides some relief. The pain moves around between the testicles and base of the penis. Sometimes it disappears completely. I have not been tested for an STI, mainly because I have been married for over 5 years and have no other sexual partners. There have also been no physical signs, i.e. discharge, burning/pain while urinating, cloudy or smelly urine, blood in urine/ejaculate, etc. I have had issues with urination for at least 10 years. They include constant urge, inability to urinate when I feel the urge. I am currently uninsured, so I am trying to find some possible answers before I make it into a doctors office.","Hi, In my opinion the radiating pain in your testicles isn't coming from the herniation or the medications you take it actually came from you renal system which is mentioned of having history of issues for the past ten years, so I think you have some sort of renal stone or a gravel in your ureters that prevents you from urinating freely to the end. You will need some investigation like SUA, RH factor, ASCOT Title, urinalysis and U/S of your abdomen and pelvis to know exactly where is the pathology exactly for specific treatments.

I can understand your concern. No need to worry about heart diseases as your 2d echo and TMT (trade mill test) are normal. In my opinion, you are mostly having musculoskeletal cause for your chest discomfort. Your chest discomfort is associated with exertion (playing tennis), so musculoskeletal cause is more likely. So follow these steps for better symptomatic relief in musculoskeletal discomfort. 1. Avoid awkward movements. 2. Sit with proper back and chest support. 3. Apply warm water pad on affected areas of chest. 4. Avoid heavyweight lifting and strenuous exercise. 5. Avoid bad postures in sleep. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","I have general gum recession on my bottom teeth and slight recession on my upper canines. Im thinking about getting gum grafts to cover the exposed root surfaces. But as Im currently wearing braces, Im not sure what I should do. Should I wait until the orthodontic treatment is over and then get gum grafts? Or is during the orthodontic treatment fine?","Dear friend. Thanks for sharing your concern. As you are wearing orthodontic braces for teeth alignment, your teeth will take new position due to it root movements.Therefore, it is best to go for gum grafts only after that. Also remember mild recession can itself get corrected after orthodontic braces removal. It is only in severe recession cases you need to get your gums covered with tissues through grafts. That will reduce your teeth sensitivity as well as enhance esthetically. Meanwhile, it is advised to get your teeth cleaned once, upon consulting your orthodontist, because deposition of calculus and stains also leads to gum recession. Maintain very good oral hygiene, and you can use antiseptic mouth rinses too. Hope it helps. Thanks. Take care."

The lumps are getting more and when I touch they hurt! Can you please give me some advice.","Hi and welcome to Chat Doctor. Bloating and vomiting are nonspecific symptoms, but these lumps you're feeling are definitely something that must be evaluated! You should do at least ultrasound to rule some serious diagnosis out. Usually such symptoms are caused by gastritis, gErd or hiatus hernia, so gastrostomy should be performed too. There is no specific cure. If you have only gastritis this is treated by changing dietary habits. You should avoid alcohol, coffee,smoking, fats and fast food, carbonated Chat Doctor.  1 hour after meal you should not sit or lay. Also lay with elevated upper body.

O have 2 fibroids in my uterus, does conceiving effect it?","Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum.  As you describe both of you are perfect in the tests of gynecologist, you need not have this treatment. But if 3 years passed after the marriage, most of the doctors use this treatment.  Mention is a purified combination of follicle stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone. To induce ovulation and enable pregnancy in women.  In women, Chat Doctor is used together with other hormones called follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) in the treatment of infertility.  So there is every possibility of getting pregnant. It needs per vaginal ultrasound scanning at the time of expected ovulation, to see there is maturation of the follicles, and ovulation.  If you don't get pregnant in the first time, you may become pregnant you will become pregnant in the second cycle. So never get confused, or get anxiety, as they may spoil the process.

Sandra","Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor. Thanks for your query. I understand that 600 dollars is a huge amount and it's even puzzling to me why a course of antibiotics and a cream would cost that much.  I presume that you don't have insurance, so the only option would be to be prescribed more cost-effective medication.  Furthermore, I would suggest that you can let the CRNP know that you cannot afford the medication and request her to prescribe something else more cost-effective and affordable. Since acne is not a serious condition, I don't think your grandson needs a very strong antibiotic or other expensive medication.  Wish you all the best."

Hip and upper thigh pain which is of burning nature and is occurring more in sitting position especially in obese individuals (as in your case) is suggestive of NEURALGIA PARENTHETICAL. This condition results due to the compression of Lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (pinched nerve) at the level of groin fold.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.",I have suffered from what seemed to be RA for five years now. I was treated with methotrexate yet continued to suffer joint pain at times when having allergic reactions. I was tested by an allergy doctor and told I did not test positive to any known allergens on tests. Yet continue to have knee joint pain and itchy tattoos that turn bumpy throughout the year. On and off. I discontinued Methotrexate treatment and I went on a hunch and was treated for Lyme disease. I am around rescue dogs as a hobby not all the time. I got better and was able to walk again. However now I find whenever I have allergic reactions itchy tattoos sinus issues my knees become painful again. Any ideas? Tatto related?,"Hello, I can understand your concern for side effects of tattoos. After analyzing your query it appears that you are quite stressed regarding the tattoos and its side effects. Though in general if the tattoos are made in sterile procedure then there is no any harm of the same but in case if the tattoos are carved by unsterile needle or is made with infected needle then can transmit multiple infections. Temporarily it can cause secondary infection and later on the tattoos can cause permanent darkening of the skin which is actually difficult to be managed. You can take further guidance from a family physician. Take care."

It is soft, no pain.  She has been running a low grade fever and has been very tired.  The doctor ordered a ultrasound which was inconclusive and sent her to a surgeon.  She is getting a CT tomorrow as the ultrasound showed a nodule on the right and a mass on the left.  The surgeon said whatever it is it needs to come out.  What are they suspecting?She does not smoke or drink, has a history of atrial fib and was on amiodarone until her doctor discontinued it 2 months ago due to high liver studies.  she is now on only beta blockers.  Her thyroid studies at her last physical 6 months ago were normal.","Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. By your history and description, your mother is mostly suffering from thyroid cancer. Her CT report clearly mentioned left sided mass and right sided nodule. So possibility of papillary thyroid cancer is more. Old age is an independent risk factor. It is usually painless and present only as enlarged mass in the neck. So better to get done fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) for the confirmation of papillary thyroid cancer. Consult oncologist and plan future treatment. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your mother. Thanks."

This may result due to compression of the nerve at some level during its course or may also result due to some systemic diseases.

Thank you for your query. I am Chat Doctor, I understand your concerns and I will try to help you as much as I can. Premature ejaculation is uncontrolled ejaculation either before or shortly after sexual penetration. It happens with minimal sexual stimulation and before the person wishes. Most cases of premature ejaculation do not have a clear cause. With sexual experience and age, men often learn to delay orgasm. Premature ejaculation may occur with a new partner. It may happen only in certain sexual situations or if it has been a long time since the last ejaculation. Psychological factors such as anxiety, guilt, or depression can also cause it. In some cases, it may be related to a medical cause such as hormonal problems, injury, or a side effect of certain medicines. I hope I have answered you query.

They are accelerated by factors affecting blood vessels such as high blood pressure, diabetes, smoking, high cholesterol etcetera. So the only thing that can be done to slow down this process is checking for the presence of those factors and ad Chat Doctor. As for the mild volume loss that means the mild shrinking of the brain.

Till today, he has got 5 dialysis done.","Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor, The need for dialysis depends on the clinical status of the patient and blood creatinine levels. Dialysis also depends on the underlying cause of raised creatinine levels. If the creatinine was high due to obstruction caused by bladder tumor, removal of tumor will reduce the creatinine levels. However, if the high creatinine level was due to primary kidney disease, the status of the kidneys has to be assessed to know the requirement of dialysis. Thanks and take care Chat Doctor."
"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.",I am a female of 49 years. Suddenly my front portion of throat have swollen with a lump (approx 15cm radius) and on one side of the neck. Doctor advised me  certain blood and other tests to test forThyroid diseases. But reports came normal. This symtom has developed for the last three days. What could be the disease? I am on medicine for Arthritis for 10 years and have no major problems. Please help.,"Hi! Good morning. I am Chat Doctor answering your query. Even though your thyroid blood reports are within normal limits, still the swelling could be related to thyroid apart from other swellings of the neck. However, it might not be possible to diagnose the lump without a clinical examination, and a confirmatory test like an FNAC/core biopsy along with an ultrasound of the lump. I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts.

Next day count raised to 1.6K but now it has come to 43K on third day. Do I have to worry as he is hospitalised and seems doctors are not taking it serious. Please advice.","Hi, Sorry to hear about your brother and also appreciate your concern. The number of platelet count in dengue is of prognostic value;it means that it tells us how the disease is progressing and if platelet count has come down to 43K from 1.6K in one day, it should be followed up keenly although in my opinion a retest is a must. If it goes down further, he may need platelet infusion. Please talk to the doctor and keep an eye over the platelet count and the overall condition of your brother. I hope this answers your question.

Have seen the nurse every few days and have been advised wound is fine and has healed. However since Saturday I have a hard lump attached to my scrotum and it is the same as previously had before drained. Can you advise what I should do? Is this normal for abscesses to come back so soon?","Thank you for your query. You are probably suffering from Sebaceous cyst of scrotum, which are getting secondarily infected, resulting in abscess formation. The infected ones are operated, as because they are multiple, and the symptomatic ones are left alone. Hot fomentation, local antibiotic ointment application and oral penicillin are the main stay of treatment. Please do also check your blood sugar levels, and ensure that you maintain personal hygiene.

I can understand your concern. Your blood pressure and heart rate are normal, but since you are having history of atrial fibrillation and ablation, better to first rule out coronary artery disease as a cause for your left arm and Chest pain. So first get done 2d echo, stress test (trade mill test) and coronary angiography (if required). If all these are normal then no need to worry about heart diseases. Musculoskeletal pain can also cause similar symptoms. So avoid heavyweight lifting and strenuous exercise. Take painkiller and muscle relaxant Chat Doctor.  Apply warm water pad on affected areas.

After she throws up she will continue eating and will be fine for the rest of the day until the next morning. I dont know why this is happening, she is not running a fever nor is she complaining of stomach pains.","Our stomach secretes acid which helps in digestion. It is secreted throughout the day. Throughout the night, the acid gets collected. This acid irritates the inner lining of the stomach. So, in the morning when your child takes in the food, the already irritated gastric wall revolts, and she vomits out the contents of her breakfast. But in the process of digesting the breakfast, the gastric acid becomes utilized and such a situation does not arise till next morning. Hence, she remains fine throughout the day."

Been to an allergist and told I do have even more allergies, but would not account for the high WBC. Sed rate slightly elevated. Please advise. Jen","Hi and thanks for the question, Chronic elevation of the ABCs deserves a more critical evaluation. In your case especially, the association with increased ESR, fatigue and petechial suggest exclusion of a bone marrow malignancy, especially a leukemia. A bone marrow biopsy might be compelling. Secondly, I would to suggest carrying out Anti-nuclear antibodies, HLA27 and autism antibodies for your symptoms are also very compatible with systemic lupus erythematous, which is an autoimmune disease. The symptoms as I said are very suggestive of a leukemia. An appropriate diagnosis is critical, for the setting up of an appropriate treatment plan. Delayed diagnoses my make the prognosis more faint. I suggest you book an appointment with the hematologist, to rule out a leukemia or any possible blood malignancy, and possibly systemic lupus erythematous.

However, it seems that you are using it even when there is no fever. Stop using it by the clock, and use it only if there is fever above 99.5 degrees F. Why did the fever occur? Most likely a virus, but it is safer to go to his pediatrician in routine hours within a day if possible. Use sponging as a tool to reduce fever - as your child had a fit in the past, don't allow the fever to rise beyond 100 F. I hope that helps. Best wishes."

It itches terribly, and often leaves a burn of flakey dry skin in my underwear. I know that I have psoriasis on my scalp. I was just wondering if it can affect my butt cheeks and also my genital area? I ve had vaginal itch since I was young. Yeast infection medicines dont work, rarely will an anti-itch cream work. It was localized on one side of my vagina for 10 years and had since spread to both sides. My family doctor just says to use anti-itch, but I think there s a bigger issue or a better answer. The left (original) side had turned a darker color and is thicker. What exactly could be the issue?","Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor Psoriasis is a likely possibility as it can very well involve the body folds. Psoriasis classically involves the extensors like scalp, elbows, knee, shins and lower back, but sites like maxilla, groin folds can also be involved either together with the extensors or solely, where it is classically known as inverse psoriasis would advise that you see a dermatologist for a confirmatory diagnosis. Psoriasis in the body folds responds very well to topical steroids as well as topical immunomodulators like tacrolimus/pimecrolimus ointment. An OTC antihistamine once daily e.g. cetirizine would help you symptomatically with the itch. Regards"

Is the liver enzymes and low vitamin d related. the doctor said not to worry about the liver enzymes. she put me on 50,000 units of vitamin d.","Hi, Thanks for writing in. Liver enzymes might be elevated due to disease and this can lead to reduced synthesis of vitamin D. It will help to know by how much your liver enzymes are raised and then treat any condition that is causing it. Since the doctor has told not to worry therefore I think the liver enzymes are not very high to cause a concern. However, you might have vitamin D deficiency and this requires you to take supplement. The pap smear showing hyperplasia requires discussion with the pathologist. Hyperplasia itself does not indicate cancer but might be a precancerous stage. You might vitamin D for now.

When the motility falls between 25-50 percent on a single ejaculate, this may not reflect a real problem. When the motility consistently falls below 25 percent, the chances of a problem are much higher. When the motility consistently falls below five to 10 percent, the chances that fertility is normal is highly unlikely.

Thank-you Swaroopa.","Hi... Recurrent fever with swollen glands in the neck for the past 15 days could be ABV infection or otherwise called infectious mononucleosis. It is a self limiting prolonged viral illness. Rarely it can cause complications. I will suggest you how a viral illness behaves so that you will be more confident. Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days.

When I use medicine I am feel better and when I stop to eat medicine it starts, kindly advise me medicine .",Dear .... Many thanks for the mail. A slightly big liver usually does not mean anything serious unless the liver function tests show some abnormal readings. So an LFT needs to be done. Like wise ultrasound evidence of gas in the stomach also does not mean anything. You will require an endoscopy test if not already done and I need to know the report. If you feel better while you take medicine denotes that you have some acidity problem. I suggest you continue the same medicine till you send me the reports I asked for.

I don t have any money, I am now disabled and not working, I need help and some answers. Is this questionnaire set up to help or to make money? Sorry about the attitude but I am tired of trying to find the truth about my case and because I am unable to make the living that I once made because of the Fibro, I am left in the dark.","Hi, thank-you for providing the brief history of you. A thorough clinical Musculoskeletal assessment is advised.a little knowledge about the fibromyalgia is needed. Fibromyalgia is a condition where the pain is in the fibers of the muscle. Each muscle is composed of multiple muscle fibers and inflammation happening there will lead to the dysfunction in the circuiting of the muscle fibers to produce the contraction and relaxation. Also to understand here that the medication is a symptomatic relief and not a long term solution as the body is a medicine of its own and medication used acts as a supportive therapy to allow body to heal on its own. Also, in my clinical practice most Fibromyalgia cases we recommend physical therapy, meditation and breathing exercises. As physical therapy will help improve the muscle refunctioning and also improve the metabolism and immune system to reduce the inflammation. Also, Therapeutic ultrasound therapy and TENS therapy have been useful to reduce the pain, but importantly exercises are the choice. Meditation helps improve the control over the anxiety and leads to cooling of aggression. Breathing exercises helps to improve the oxygen carrying blood cells which acts as a fuel in the metabolism and reduce the metabolic waste as well. RegardsJay In Chat Doctor."

My right side cheeks and face feels kinda tender when touched. I know I have been experiencing headaches and neck pains as well. Im just concerned due to a previous aneurysm on right side in back of my head lower to neck.,"Hello, I can understand your concern. It is logical that you can assume it to be aneurysm again as you have had it before. However, if it was aneurysm, you should be feeling symptoms like pulsations, numbness over the area etc. What you are experiencing is a sharp and dull pain episodes in the cheek area which seems like pain from infection of the oral cavity or due to sinusitis. It could also be pain related to Trigeminal or Facial nerve. I would advise you to visit a dentist for examination of the oral cavity to look for presence of infection in the area. If dentist clears you for any loci of infection, an ENT specialist or physician can examine you for sinus or nerve related problems.

If you are a diabetic and on insulin or oral medicine then it may be due to hypoglycemia. The dizziness may be due to thiamine induced hypotension (excessive fall of BP).

The side effect of Ventolin is increased heart rate but let me assure you that this is a very widely used medicine and well tolerated and so you need not worry about the side effects. Give your child steam inhalation twice or thrice a day and I think that she would get some relief. Also add some antiallergic syrup like Relent which will also help in diluting the cough.

It could be atomic dermatitis, basically allergic causing rashes over the face, in the creases and also other body folds. Did he have similar complaints from a very young age? It could be an allergy which increases with weather changes, dust, exposure to sun, certain plants, animals etc. Also, certain foods like nuts, seafood, processed foods, etc. You will need to keep a track of when exactly the rashes come up and if there is a common cause each time. Allergies generally reduce as the child grows, but repeated exposure to the cause can make it recur often. Use a mild sunscreen when outside.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Dear sir,Recently my Father-in-law(FIL) saw the Heart doc for ByPass related surgery. Doctor suggested to go for \""Ultra Sound Abdomen\"" and \""Dopler study of renal arteries\"" first as my FIL has very high BP(200/100).  \""Ultra Sound Abdomen\"" report says \""Inter Polar cyst measuring 12 MM noted in the right kidney\"" and \""Prostatomegaly\"". I am worried, what does it mean?  Your guidance is highly appreciated.Thanks In Advance","Hello dear, Thank you for your contact to Chat Doctor. I read and understand your concern. I am Chat Doctor answering your concern. Cyst in the kidney and high blood pressure is suggestive of the damage caused by the high blood pressure. High blood pressure in the kidney can cause damage on the renal calyxes and can cause cyst. It requires surgical correction. Further management of the blood pressure can also prevent further damage to the kidney. Prostatomegaly means enlarged prostate. Enlarged prostate usually occurs with being prostatic hypertrophy. This needs to be confirmed with the PSA level in the blood. It will be higher on the carcinoma of the prostate. If its carcinoma it needs to be managed as per the malignancy.

At first the pain was in my tooth and spread to around 3 other teeth to the left. However, the pain soon reached the gums like a throbbing pain or heart beat when Im lying down and is getting really painful and unbearable at times. I can now feel a small bump on my upper lip near the teeth. What could it be? (Im seeing my dentist today after I though I could deal with the pain)Thanks,","Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query. The possible cause of plan is because of the tooth infection. The type of pain what you are getting is characteristic feature of pulpits. The lump could be because of the abscess formation. The normal filling will not solve the issue. The tooth has to be treated with RCT or extraction. Take a radiograph to rule out the infection. You can take a course of antibiotics like penicillin and metronidazole combination after consulting the physician. I hope my answer will help you. Take care"
"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.",last night while eating an orange I started to choke.  Iwas coughing quite hard and then I could not get an air. My chest was suddenly very painful and the pain radiated down both my arms. I blacked out and when I came to the orange piece was on the rug beside my mouth and the pain was gone.  What happened to me.,"Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. You had choking and aspiration of food particles in trachea. Your symptoms are associated with eating. So by mistake when we aspirate food particles in trachea (wind pipe), it gets blocked. Due to this, we can not get air and hence we feel breathlessness. During this episode our body is deprived of oxygen and so black out is seen. To overcome this, violent coughing (reflex) is done by the body to cough put food particle. Once food particles are out, wind pipe is open, and you can breathe normally. So better to chew properly while swallowing. Do not speak much while eating. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."

Thanks",Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Read your query. Excess tissue growth with ill-fitting denture as you have described is usually harmless referred as Ellis fissuratum. This is usually cause by chronic tissue irritation by an ill-fitting dentures and its response to the soft tissue. Biopsy is usually done to rule out any other lesions including neoplasm. I would suggest you to go ahead with surgical removal of the tissue. After the healing get a new denture done with proper fitting and proper maintenance of the denture. Hope this was useful.

We had IVF to conceive our first child so did not believe it was possible to fall pregnant naturally otherwise I would not have carried on taking tetrasyl. How dangerous is this to our unborn child? Very concerned and would appreciate some advice.,"Hi there,Tetras is an antibiotic which is not recommended to be taken in pregnancy, but it is not known to cause any major defect in the baby if taken during the first trimester. Studies have shown that it effects the baby if taken after 4 months of pregnancy, causing the babies teeth to be discolored and can cause hardening and cause excess calcification of teeth and bones which is irreversible. But, since you are exposed to tetracycline at such an early gestation it is very unlikely to have affected your baby. Only minor abnormalities are known to occur in few women. Do not be overly concern and get a NT scan at 11 weeks and an anomaly scan done at 20 weeks to check for anomaly. Hope this helps. Regards."

On your description - not painful, hanging (which I assume you mean not firmly attached but mobile) and the recent onset - I can tell that there is no likelihood of serious infection or dental cyst/tumor. It could be a granuloma or a papilloma. All conditions are self regressing and you don't have to worry. Try not to disturb it though, and if you develop signs of infection (reddening, fluid discharge, multiple sores in mouth etc.) get it attended immediately.

It may be just degenerative changes of the bones or the disc, pressing on your vertebral artery which supplies the brain. I would recommend you a X-ray of cervical column. Heat procedures and a cervical collar would improve your situation. I would also recommend betahistine twice daily or finalizing for the dizziness. Hope to have been helpful!

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hi, I m 22 and have moderate to severe plaque psoriasis on my face, scalp and torso. I ve exhausted most topical creams and ointments, taken courses of steroids with no real results. Would phototherapy be my next course of action. Is thinking about biologics too radical?","Hello. Thank you for writing to topical treatment with ointments and lotions is usually combined with systemic treatment/ oral treatment for psoriasis involving > 20% body surface area. Phototherapy, though is a good choice for extensive body involvement with plaque psoriasis, however, certain body sites like scalp are resistant even to phototherapy. Apart from phototherapy Oral methotrexate is a well known treatment for plaque psoriasis and can be considered in a healthy young adult. Biologics like golimumab, ustekinumab are not first line options in a young patient with limited involvement with plaque psoriasis. Scalp involvement responds well to topical steroids lotions with or without salicylic acid. Vitamin D analogues e.g. calcitriol/ calcitriol lotions are also effective in scalp psoriasis. I suggest that you visit a dermatologist in your region. Your dermatologist will assess the severity of involvement and advice accordingly. Regards"

I had been painting and scraping the garage, on a ladder. thought maybe this triggered something. It went on, off and on for 2 weeks. We went to visit our son and NYC. Put on 45 miles walking. no problem. Came home. Off and on vibration started again, then stopped completely for ;7 days. Now back again. I am 64, weight about 148, take advair for asthma. The vibration is annoying and scary because I don t know what is causing it and hoped after it had stopped for 7 days that it would go away on its own.","Hi. Regards. Thanks for an elucidated history, which say you have walked 45 miles too. This indicates that there is no intra-abdominal problem. The vibration in the left lower abdomen looks to be due to the tics of the musculature of that part of the abdominal wall possibly due to a pinched nerve, or an automatic discharge of the nerve or may be a disc in the thoracic region. Get examined by an Orthopedic Surgeon / General Surgeon to get a physical examination done, an ultrasonography of the abdomen and an MRI of the thoracolumbar spine.

Throughout pregnancy, the fetus bathes in a translucent pouch that gradually fills with amniotic fluid until the 35th week of amenorrhea where the amount of fluid is at its maximum with about 980 ml. Then the amniotic fluid decreases to the end to reach a volume between 600 and 800 ml approximately. The flow of the amniotic fluid signals the rupture of the membrane, and the risk of premature delivery if the term of the pregnancy is not reached. When the amount of amniotic fluid is abnormally low compared to the term of pregnancy, it is called oligoamnios. During oligoamnios, infection rate is higher. The premature rupture of the membranes (rupture before the beginning of the work) concerns 5 to 10% of the pregnancies. Its risk factors are the same as those of spontaneous preterm birth with intact membranes. This patient received a punch on her abdomen, which caused a premature rupture of the membranes and then a loss of the entirety amniotic fluid then an oligoamnios was created, and during the 2 weeks before the hospitalization, there was infection of the genital and baby components and infection dissemination by haematogenous route Causing endocarditis.

If you cannot read the urine test properly, you should go for the serum beta-ChatDoctor titles along with a trans-vaginal sonogram to clarify the issue. The spotting could possibly be due to an implantation bleed, but, it needs to be clarified.

Early pregnancy may naturally have periods of episodic vaginal bleeding with clots. This is caused as the baby with the sac in early pregnancy is too small to fill up whole of the uterus. The exposed inner lining of uterus may degenerate and bleed just like a normal menstrual cycle. I am assuming that your ultrasonography after the gush of bleeding showed a live baby with evidence of fetal heart beat. In that case chance of abortion is minimal. ASA or aspirin tablets are given in pregnancy to help in free flow of blood between mother and fetus. Please write back if you have any more queries.

It means the inside layer of uterus called as endometrium is present outside the uterus, and it responds to the cyclical changes as inside uterus causing bleeding. As you have menses, there will be bleeding from this endometrium which can be present anywhere in the abdomen.the commonest site is ovary and all around outer side of uterus. So premenstrual there will be pain which depends up on the organ involved and the extent. So you can consult a gynecologist and get an ultrasound scan to rule out any cysts in ovary which is causing problems for you.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","My husband was on hemodialysis for about a year.  Last December we began with peritoneal dialysis at home and have been doing this for almost a year.  He had his catheter moved last June as it was much too low.  Since then he has been retaining fluid in his abdomen.  He recently had a CAT scan and a ecocardiogram which showed a heart problem which his doctor said could be controlled with medication.  While in the hospital, his blood pressure dropped so low he was given a bag of saline solution which raised it but he was taken off this medication for his heart.  Now he is at home and has a physical therapist come to our home twice a week and he is doing light exercises but his biggest problem, which has been with him for about three months, is shortness of breath.  It is from all of the fluid in his abdomen pressing on his diaphram, etc.  He has increased his trouser size by two inches.  I called this to the attention of his nephrologist as his stomach is like a big bowl of jelly.  Nothing is being done to take care of this fluid except the doctor has put him back on hemodialysis with no reduction of fluid.  Is there a possibility that there is a leak inside from his catheter or could it be a buildup of fluids from the peritoneal dialysis which I understand does not always completely flush all the fluids out of his body? Sorry about this being such a long messge but we are at a wits end as to finding out what is causing this problem.  Could you possibly help us by offering your guideance about the fluid. Thank you in advance.","HIT hanks for your query. If there is no active peritoneal dialysis going on, then the abdominal fluid collection is unlikely to be related to the Peritoneal dialysis catheter. Ascites or fluid in the peritoneal cavity can be due to a weak heart or liver problems. I would recommend a 2D Echocardiogram, Ultrasound of the abdomen and a diagnostic ascetic fluid tap. Based on the results we could make further recommendations. Hope this helps Good luck."

But I do spend a total of 9 hours or more 5 days a week moving and running around.,"Hello dear, thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. In my opinion you are having allergic bronchitis. Coughing and itching are characteristics for allergic disease (process). Since you are having symptoms mostly at night, you may be allergic to your night clothes or bedsheet or pillow covers etc. And these act as allergen and cause symptoms. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done PFT (Pulmonary Function Test) to diagnose bronchitis. Change your bedsheet, pillow cover and night clothes. Start using new cotton ones. Also take antihistamine Chat Doctor.  You will mostly be alright by these changes."

I took the pill for around 5 weeks without a break and now that Ive taken a break from it Ive not experienced a withdrawal bleed and Im getting very worried. Could you offer me an explanation? Ive taken one test and it was negative. Just want to know whats going on with my body, Ive been taking the pill almost 3 years with no problems like this.","HI, thanks for using Chat Doctor Microgynon is a commonly used oral contraceptive. There is a form of oral contraception where essentially it is taken for 3 months so that these women have only 4 periods a year. It is likely that the prolonged use of the medication resulted in the delay you are experiencing. Though it is understandably alarming to you, it is a result of a slight hormonal imbalance and your period will return. I hope this helps"

The pain will go after anything from a few hours to over 36 hours. Today it is particularly painful hence the search online,"You probably mean throbbing headache affecting one side of the head, right in your case. You have not mentioned whether you are a male or female. Based on that, I would consider three possible causes, a) migraine b) cluster headache and c) temporal arthritis.

Also get yourself examined by a doctor and subsequently intervene as per the cause diagnosed."

FREE PSA/TOTAL PSA was about 22.5 and according to the lab this result is normal, urine analysis shows RBC levels of 20 - 22 and WBC 2, can we know from these results if it s a gland hypertrophy or it s prostate cancer? thank you",Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. In my opinion you should not worry much about cancer. As calcification is 100% benign. It is not at all seen in malignancy.  So you should not worry much about cancer.  Your other lab reports are also normal for cancer. You are having BPH (benign prostatic enlargement) which is causing red blood cells in urine. So better to consult neurosurgeon and get done removal of prostate.  This will cure RBC in urine. And no need to worry about cancer.

So after extraction the socket needs to be curetted to remove the pus pocket and all the debris and irritants, disinfection of the socket is done, and then the wound is packed with cotton gauze .any remnants of abscessed tissue in the socket may lead to infection and pain. Secondly you may have developed a condition of Chat Doctor.  You need to get it clinically examined by a dentist to confirm and make a diagnosis. Pain the other teeth may be due to gingival infection which can be cured by scaling and root planing. About wisdom teeth, they normally erupt at the age of 18 to 27 years, so you can still wait as you will get the eruption signs once they appear. I would suggest you to get an OPG radiograph done which will show the wisdom tooth appearing as well as infection in other teeth if any, will help in deciding treatment. I hope I answered all your doubts, take care."

Since your blood pressure was so low, the first thought is that you were simply not getting enough blood to your brain. From you symptoms it sounds like your left hemisphere of the brain was affected given that you couldn't move your right leg and arm. Language also resides most commonly in the left hemisphere, so speaking would also be difficult. You didn't mention your age, but when symptoms are isolated to a side of the brain, what needs to be done is an MR-Angiogram (blood vessel imaging with MRI) or CT-angiogram (blood vessel imaging with a CT) of the arteries in the neck and brain to make sure that there is no narrowing of the blood vessel that could result in the symptoms just affecting one side of the brain. If neither of those tests are possible, then as a bare minimum a carotid ultrasound should be done. Alternatively, but much less likely is that you could have a migraine that caused paralysis and focal neurological symptoms. They are very rare, but still a possibility. The symptoms usually resolve in a few hours to a day. Lastly, a seizure could have also occurred which caused you to lose consciousness. There is a condition where after the seizure, it takes the brain time to recover and there can be difficulty with movement and language. Again, I feel that that is less likely. None-the-less you need more testing done to make sure the blood vessel are open. Also, they need to investigate the cause of your low blood pressure. It can be due to a Chat Doctor.  You should definitely speak with your primary care physician to have all of that investigated. I hope this helps. Sincerely, Kristoffer Mission"

Some natural remedies are-mixture of lemon juice and cream; apply on face. Put lemon juice onto basil leaves. This is great for getting rid of pigmentation marks and dark circles that may have been a long-time problem. Apply lime (NIMBY) to the affected area, and after 15 minutes wash it off. This needs to be done on a daily basis. Other remedy is Comic acid cream which lightens up the dark spots but takes some time. However, mellow is a facial treatment using Vitamins and Mineral injections to add that healthy glow to skin which radiates energy and vitality. Subdermal vitamin injections rejuvenate the cells, making them more active and thereby stimulating the production of collagen and elastin. Overall it reduces dark spots; effects seen faster than comic acid. You can continue same treatment for dark spots along with natural remedies and sunscreen creams. Take care. Best regards,"

Age more than 50 is an individual risk factor for bronchitis. You are also having wheezing with shortness of breath, these also favors possibility of bronchitis more. Bilateral septal thickening is also seen in bronchitis due to inflammation. So consult pulmonologist and get done PFT. PFT will not only diagnose bronchitis, but also tell you about severity of the disease. And for treatment severity is important. You may require inhaled bronchodilators. No need to worry much for septal thickening in both lungs."

You did safe sex on 23rd Jan as per last period date and took Unwanted 72 pill on 25th Jan, which will give extra protection. In this case, your chance of pregnancy is NIL due to safe period.

If your period doesn't start within 2 weeks, you must undergo one pelvic ultrasound scan and hormone test to pinpoint the diagnosis. You may require progesterone pill to induce period.

He has multiple hairline fractures in his spine and ribs and has become quite stooped and seems to have difficulty breathing.  Is the raspy voice related to the condition of his spine,"Hi, Thanks fir writing in. A raspy voice is due to stimulation of the recurrent laryngeal nerve which supplies the vocal cords. It is possible that your friend has a lowered immune status after taking treatment for multiple myeloma. This might cause him to have infection in the throat which is causing irritation to the recurrent laryngeal nerve. Any infection or condition in the throat might cause the raspy voice. It is suggested that he consults the ENT specialist immediately and has a clinical examination of his throat done. This will show any inflammatory changes in the region and whether it requires treatment. Please tell him to do throat gargle with warm water twice daily to soothe the throat. The raspy voice is not related to his spine but might have an indirect association to his treatment which he is getting right now. Please do not worry."

Candid B cream is an antifungal cream with steroid. This cream is used only in specific dermatological conditions as prescribed a qualified physician. There are a variety of skin disorders causing dark pigmentation. The commonest cause of dark pigmentation on cheeks in an elderly lady is a condition called Plasma. The cause of plasma is complex. There is a genetic predisposition to plasma, with at least one-third of patients reporting other family members to be affected. In most people plasma is a chronic disorder.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hi iam 34years. We are trying for a baby for the past 1 year... my periods were regular and my doctor said my ovulation is normal. I had been taking folic acid supplements only. I did foliicular study for about 5 months ina row and everything was normal. Recently my last cycle ended up being an anovulatory cycle. I got my regular periods without any delay. My bleeding was also normal. My husbands reports are normal too. All mu harmonal blood tests were normal, the same month i had anovulation. Is thus possible. What is happening to me?","Hi I think you can take some medicines like camphene for inducing ovulation.  Track your follicles' growth by repeated ultrasound and when follicle is more than 17 to 18 mm, take injection for rupture of follicles.  Be in contact with your husband every 2 to 3 days after your periods stop. Take progesterone for next 2 weeks after rupture is confirmed on ultrasound. Do a urine pregnancy test after that. You can try like that for 3 to 6 cycles."

If you have a regular cycle of 30\u00a0days then you had sex in safe period plus you took posting 2 within 24 hours which means very less chance of getting pregnant.

Have you taken an MRI of the shoulder? If so what was the reports? If not then please do take it. I suspect this to be a rotator cuff injury. Because any injury happening to the shoulder with two muscle injury falls in the group. The rotator cuff muscles are weak. You need to work out behind it. Shoulder function can resume only when we have good range of motion in passive for all the movements and also if we overcome the pain.  In fact, I should share one of the rotator cuff injury cases of mine. It was a case of 65 years old female with the above-mentioned injury. No passive or active shoulder movements. But to overcome the problems, I use to make the muscle tire by active ROM exercises and no weights. Just gravity assisted and gravity resisted ones. In fact all the shoulder movements like - flexion, extension, rotation, abduction, adduction and circumduction. At the end of the 12th week, she had the best movements without any kind of pain and shoulder was much stronger than before. I will advise you to look for a competitive physiotherapist who can help you get the best outcome score. If left untreated it will lead to other pathologies which are not accepted.

He says he has a non-cell malignancy. He told me today it is stage 4 melanoma. He is in his 4th week of daily radiation, but he said that he has been told he is inoperable, uncurable, but manageable. He originally told me that the tumor was solo, and not attached to anything when he had an ultrasound, but 4 days later when they did the 2nd surgery it has wrapped itself around things in his neck. What kind of cancer does this? Is he terminal?He lives in another state and I think he is keeping information from me to spare my feelings?","Hi, Thanks for writing in. It appears that your son has a melanoma that might have spread to neck lymph nodes. This is a possibility and has to be confirmed by doing a biopsy. What happens is that lymph nodes are found in many regions of the body and are small unless they are stimulated by disease process. When there is a disease in a person then the lymph nodes of a particular region get enlarged and this is a reaction by the immune mechanism. Since your son has been told that he has a melanoma, it has probably involved the neck lymph nodes. The lymph nodes in the neck are close to the carotid artery and internal jugular vein, and it is possible that the lymph nodes have wrapped around these. Doing a surgery in this condition is not possible and radiation usually works. It is suggested that you spend some time with your son by going over to his place and know more about the treatment he should be taking for his condition. Please do not worry."

I carefully read your question and I understand your concern. I will try to explain you something and give you my opinion. You must know that Adderall is a stimulant of central nervous system. It affects chemicals in the brain that contributes to hyper reactivity. Through stimulation of nervous system in a secondary way it stimulates the electrical system of the heart. This stimulation might cause fast heart beats over 100 or generate other electrical impulses in parts of the heart different from normal sinus Rhythm. This causes premature heart contraction that we call extra systolic beats. In this situation you feel your heart like running, making pauses or skipping beats. You might feel anxiety, difficulties in breathing deeply, palpitations or pulsations to your veins all over. Every kind of stimulation of nervous system might cause this rhythm issue to simple emotional stress, coffee consumption or pathologies like anemia, hyperthyroidism, this kind of medicine that act directly to the system. So, nothing serious is happening to your heart. it's a reaction to this stimulation. My opinions is to discuss this effects with your doctor and decide together what to do with and fit is possible or allowed to stop it. Hope I was helpful. Best regards."

He used a Veet Hair removal cream for all his body on saturday.(including the balls under penis) And next day he saw a blood in his urine. He told me is soo much,"Hello, I can understand your concern for the blood in boxers of your husband after applying the meet cream. It appears that your husband has developed irritant dermatitis after applying the meet cream over the genital area. These creams are quite prone to cause the burn on the skin and therefore can cause damage leading to oozing of blood from the affected site. I suggest you to ask him to do cold compression over the affected area. Till the time you meet a family physician you can ask him to apply an antibiotic cream such as funding cream or mupirocin cream over the affected area. Ask him to wear lose cotton clothes so that it should not irritate the scrotal skin. All the best."
"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","I have had very heavy and painful periods for many years.....I am trying to conceive right now (miscarried in November, ectopic in March which resulted in losing my right tube.....is there any chance for me and could the cause be rooted in my heavy, lumpy and painful periods?","Hallow Madam, Since you have conceived twice in your life, there are very good chances that you will conceive again. However, the history of ectopic pregnancy cannot be ignored, and you will have to be on the guard for it. The best option is to monitor the ovulation by ultrasonography and time your sexual intercourse on the day of egg release. You will have to submit for the ultrasonography day 9 onwards for about 5-6 days. This should give you better results. If you choose to have pregnancy when the egg from the side on which tube is intact is selected, the chances of pregnancy will still be higher. I hope this helps you."

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","I have noticed for about the last 6 or so months when I sit down in a hard-back chair there is an area in the middle to lower section (about where my belly button would be) of my spine that begins to hurt. I have a bruise at the location of the pain -- probably because I am a student and my back is constantly being pressed against hard desk chairs. When I run my fingers along my spine, I do notice a slight protrusion at the source of the pain -- I m not sure if it can be seen, but I can feel it. I don t have any serious history of either back or muscle issues. I do feel quite restless when sitting down -- I am constantly shifting. I also get the urge to crack my back at least two to three times per day. Any ideas about the pain in the one spot of my spine? Why is it sticking out? Thanks!","Hello ! I understand your concern. In my opinion a disc bulge in that level of your column may be the cause of these symptoms. The protrusion may be an inflammatory lesion, or just the bone related with your spinal nerves at the point of the column where they get out from the spine. Other possible diagnosis, more rare may be lesions of the spine like tumors, cysts, etc. I would recommend you see a doctor and have a lumbar column x-ray and a blood routine test to rule out this diagnosis.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hello, I heard gargling hydrogen peroxide makes teeth white. I tried it, but shortly afterwards my nose started bleeding and also a little through my mouth. Is this a side affect of gargling hydrogen peroxide or may this be caused be something else?","Hello, Thanks for writing to shy Chat Doctor.  Less complex molecules that reflect less light lead to a reduction or elimination of the discoloration of both the enamel and the dentin. The length of treatment depends on the level of discoloration and on the whitening product used. It ranges from short interventions in the dental office to applications at home lasting minutes/hours per day and repeated over a number of days. Single dark teeth can also be bleached successfully. Heavy tobacco stains may need as much as three months of treatment. Whitened teeth generally do not darken after treatment or darken only slightly, and when they do, retreating the teeth can easily be done. Hope this helps you. Wishing you good health... Regards."

On the IV with antibiotics he felt bettter, now 12 hours later his stomach is bad again, he thinks its the antibiotics.  Im wondering if it is just anything he puts down his stomach affects his gallbladder????? Help I dont want another trip to er","Hello! Thank you for the query. Antibiotics quite often cause some gastrointestinal issues. Like every medicine they can irritate stomach causing stomach ache. Usually it is nothing serious, however if it starts recurring, some diagnostics is necessary. Swollen gallbladder should rather get better after antibiotics. So it is hardly possible that antibiotic itself has caused such issue. More possible is that your son has peptic ulcer which get irritated by antibiotic. In case of peptic ulcer, ultrasound is usually useless. I suggest your son to visit a doctor once again. CRP, and blood work should be done along with an ultrasound. If nothing will be found, gastrostomy should be next. Hope this will help. Regards."

It became inflamed and red very quickly. I used benadryl, it stopped the itching. Yesterday morning the swelling had spread to all 4 small toes and into my foot. My doctor prescribed prednisone and topical steroid cream. Also told me to take zyrtec or clariton over the counter. I took the steroid and it seemed to reduce the swelling but by the evening two of the insect bites were black and the surrounding area was also black and swollen. I soaked my foot in epsome salts that helped the pain and reduced the redness and swelling some. Today the bites are still very black and swollen but not exceptionally painful. Should I be concerned? Should I lance them and soak again?","Hi, thanks for using Chat Doctor It would be best not to puncture them because they can introduce infection if the technique is not sterile. You may want to add anti-inflammatory painkillers to your current regimen. They would help with pain relief and also reduce the inflammation due to the bites. Examples are ibuprofen, naproxen should continue your other medication and can also the foot baths. It is possible that the bites may become infected so if there is no improvement you may need a course of antibiotics. I hope this helps"

No pain, but slight pressure on the edge of my left ocular cavity.  I have a history of panic attacks, and this occurs during them, but at the moment, I am not having an attack.  Could this be something other than stress?","Hi, Thank you for your query. I can understand your concerns. It is not a vein but an artery, more specifically, the superficial temporal artery which pulsates. It is a branch of the external carotid artery. Furthermore, it occurs in anxiety disorders. Pulses can be abnormally strong when the patient has an elevated pulse pressure.  This would result in a strong, bounding pulse that could also be asymmetric due to anatomic variation. Bounding pulse -commonly seen in hyperkinetic circulatory states where there is vasodilation and increased stroke output. The pulse volume is high (due to high pulse pressure) with increased blood flow. Hyperkinetic circulatory states may due to excitement/anxiety. Other causes of hyperkinetic circulatory states giving rise to bounding pulse are Hyperthyroidism, Severe anemia, Beri Berg (thiamine deficiency), Arterio-venous fistula (e.g. Pages disease or hepatic failure). The most rapidly rising bounding pulse is found in AR(aortic regurgitation), PDA(patent ducts arterioles), coaptation of aorta. Regards"

I am 60 and have a business to run and I cant sleep. First port of call for practical help please.,"Hi, I can understand what you might be going through. You haven't mentioned whether your mother is on any treatment as of now and what are the exact symptoms she is suffering from as of now. I would advise you to consult a neurologist first. Thorough evaluation with blood investigations, cardiac evaluation and brain scanning would be needed to determine any primary cause of dementia. She would need treatment with medicines like donepezil which will slow down her progressive cognitive decline. In addition, if she is having any behavioral symptoms, medications might be required for that too. She could also be helped by certain behavioral measures for her memory symptoms. You can discuss this with the neurologist. Hope this information was useful. Best wishes."

YYYY@YYYY Thank you!","Thanks for your query. I have gone through your query. The limited or difficulty in mouth opening can be because of the trauma to the muscles while injecting local anesthesia or repeated injections, or it can be a disc displacement in the jaw joint that occurs if you had kept your mouth opened for long time during cleaning. Nothing to be panic, you can take analgesics like ibuprofen and muscle relaxants like chlorzoxazone. Give hot fomentation over the joint and muscles. I hope my answer will help you. Take care"

For the past week, I have had a very bad cough, but no other symptom. No runny nose, sore throat...nothing. The cough is a very deep and dry cough. I have also been feeling heaviness in my chest. Yesterday, I noticed that my body began aching. Today, my body has been aching all day. I went to urgent care, they didnt do an xray, and diognosed me with bronchitis. They gave me an anitibiotic, but im concerned because, I just dont feel like myself, and I think its something more. I should also mention that I am a smoker, and I smoke about 4-6 cigarettes a day!","Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Since you are a active smoker, possibility of bronchitis is more for your symptoms. And you are not improving because you are not taking appropriate treatment for bronchitis. Bronchitis needs inhaled treatment. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (pulmonary function test). PFT will not only diagnose bronchitis, but it will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment is based on severity only. You will improve with inhaled bronchodilator (formoterol or albuterol) and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) (budesonide or fluticasone). Don't worry, you will be alright with all these.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hi, I m a 30 year old female and on January 9 th I had emergency surgery for perforated diverticulitis of the cecum . They removed my cecum, ileocecal valve , and appendix, luckily I do not have a colostomy they were able to reconnect everything without any problems. I did have a general surgeon who actually specializes in vascular surgery do the procedure because he was on call. I have been experiencing some difficulty sleeping since surgery. I will doze off and wake up feeling nauseated and lightheaded with a weird vibratory sensation throughout my chest. Also when I stand up my vision goes dark for a few seconds. I am eating 4-5 small meals a day and drinking one Gatorade and about 2 bottled water a day. My urine is light yellow and I am going about 5-6 times a day. BM s daily to every other day, no diarrhea. I haven t been taking any pain meds since I left the hospital on the 12 th. I take Zantac and Prevacid once daily. It may just be anxiety from the whole experience but I m just a little concerned. Thanks for any advice.","Hi. I don't think it is related to surgery complication. It is procedure which can be well done by every general surgeon. It is always expected to feel some nonspecific gastrointestinal problems such as diarrhea or stomach cramps but symptoms you're saying don't seem to be serious. If you have fever associated with abdominal pain OE extensive vomiting then you should go to hospital.  For other, I suggest just to wait few more weeks. It is not so much time from surgical procedure so just be wait a bit more to see are these symptoms gonna persist. Wish you good health."
"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.",Im in the hospital.  2nd case of ischemic colitis in 7 months.  Ive had 2 previous heart attacks and a moderate aortic leak.  I understand the ischemic colitis is caused by lack of blood flow to the colon.  What causes the lack of blood flow?  No doctor can answer that yet.,"Hello Welcome to Chat Doctor Ischemic colitis is caused due to obstruction to blood flow of the colon. Cholesterol deposition in the arteries of the body lead to narrowing of the arteries. This is called atherosclerosis. Some subjects have increased tendency to atherosclerosis which depends on genetics and environmental factors. This causes narrowing of the arteries leading to stagnation of blood at these sites and subsequent formation of clots. This causes you the attacks of ischemic colitis. In you case since you have suffered from two heart attacks, I suppose you have got high propensity to atherosclerosis, may be due to genetic factors and strong family history. Treatment is blood thinners like aspirin which I suppose you are already on. Usually two blood thinners are used on recurrent attacks of ischemic colitis and even in case of previous heart attacks. So ideally you must be on two blood thinners. If despite this you have episodes of ischemic colitis you must be on higher blood thinners like warfarin. However, higher blood thinners have a potential of causing bleeding elsewhere in the body. I hope I have answered your query satisfactorily. Wishing you good healthRegards."

I wanted to know if their are any medicines that can help with this and how long does it take for them to work? I had a severe attack like this 2 1/2 years ago and was put on wellbutrin for it and the derealization went away after about 5 to 6 weeks. I went to the doctor this past tuesday and she put me on citalopram and metoporol and she said it should work much faster than wellbutrin but it hasnt worked so far and its been 4 days.,"Degree understand your concerns went through your details. I suggest you not to worry much. Derealization disorder is not a stand-alone disorder but dissociative symptoms of many conditions, in psychiatry and neurotic spectrum. It is also called Depersonalization-derealization disorder. Psychological counseling helps you understand why depersonalization and derealization occur, and helps you gain control over the symptoms so that they go away. Two such techniques include cognitive behavioral therapy and psychodynamic therapy. Depersonalization-derealization disorder may also improve when counseling helps with other mental health conditions, such as depression.

Since its only been 2 cases over 13 months, and they're not even sure it's the condos, the risk is probably very, very small but not zero.

This report broadly means that you might be having hypertension which is causing pressure on heart & causing thickening of a chamber of heart (LVH). It is also telling that one side of heart is working less than other parts(hypokinetic inferior wall), which may be because of blockage of one of the arteries of heart. Rest everything is fine.

I can understand your concern. In my opinion, we should definitely rule out lung diseases like bronchitis or asthma. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system, chest x-ray and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test).PFT will not only diagnose bronchitis or asthma, but it will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment is based on severity only. You may need inhaled bronchodilators (formoterol or albuterol) and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (budesonide or fluticasone).Don't worry, you will be alright with all these.

I understand your concern. In my opinion your troubles are probably due to a cervical disc problem. It may be dislocated, or it may be just degenerative changes to your cervical vertebral column. These changes explain the back pain, headaches, dizziness.  Also, the changes in your cervical x-ray can be explained by this diagnosis. I would recommend you have a cervical CT scan to visualize the discs and find out where the problem is. In the meantime you can use acetaminophen, ibuprofen or fetoprotein for the pain and avoid abrupt cervical movements. A cervical collar can help. Hope to have been helpful.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.",Hi Dr Age,HelloThanks for query. Based on the facts that you have narrated you have a long-standing history of pain in urethra and constant sensation to pass urine which followed after prolonged abusive masturbation which has not responded to treatment with multiple antibiotics and none of the various relevant test are conclusive as regards the diagnosis and cause of your symptoms. In view of all these symptoms started after prolonged abusive masturbation I think the prolonged masturbation has caused trivial damage to urethra resulting to form a scarring and flimsy stricture of urethra. I would suggest you to consult your urologist again and explore need for doing endoscopic examination of urethral passage (Ureteroscopy). This procedure of visualization of urethral passage directly perhaps may help to diagnose the precise cause for your symptoms. Further treatment will be decided by him on final diagnosis.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.",I have been diagnosed yet again with another UTI with Klebsiella being the bug that is always found in my urine. The dr says it is not caught from my partner but every time I have sex with him I am back to the Drs again complaining of the same symptoms. Sometimes the urine samples show nothing but most of the time it does. Why is it that I no sooner get rid of the infection then have sex and the infection starts all over again. I m beginning to wonder if my partner is the cause of all of this. Never ever had this issue before with any other partner. I m in my 40 s and have been with my partner for 2 years and am completely monogamous (never have numerous partners). I m so over this please help me,"Hello, Klebsiella is mostly and primarily found in not immunocompetent individuals, usually in hospital settings and cause the so-called hospital-acquired infections (HAI). They could cause opportunistic urinary tract infections, pneumonia and other respiratory infections, bacteremia, infection of surgical wounds, etcetera. In diabetics, people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, etcetera. Due to their particular structure, Klebsiella species are naturally resistant to penicillin-type antibiotics, some Aminoglycosides (Gentamicin, Kanamycin, Streptomycin, etcetera.). Often their treatment is possible only through the use of Carbapenems and Fluoroquinolones (Ciprofloxacin, Levofloxacin, etcetera.). Klebsiella is considered part of the normal flora in various parts of intestine and colon. Recent studies have reported that recurrent Klebsiella urinary tract infections are caused by persistent Klebsiella found in the urinary tract even after appropriate antibiotic treatment and all persons with recurrent infections were elderly and diabetics. Recurrent strains of Klebsiella also had increased adhesion and invasiveness compared to colonization strains (those causing infection for the first time) and this might explain their tendency to cause repeated infections. Now, it is known that frequent sexual intercourse is the strongest risk factor for recurrent urinary tract infections in healthy women, and it is why your disease comes back each time you have sex with your partner. The fact that the disease comes back after you have sex with your partner puts in high risk of future urinary tract infections. In your case the following measures could be of benefit"

I ws told few months back that the tooth needed a root canal. A temporary coverin ws done but within days it came off and exposed tooth since then. I ws advised meftal - forte tablets to take for pain by a chemist. Please advice ASAP if i should take to subside the pain for now. Within 2 or 3 days i would be visiting a good dentist. Thank you!,"Hello, I am glad to assist you. The temporary filling placed would be expected to wear away if only placed to cover the tooth while expecting you to return for a root canal therapy. The filling needs to be removed to enter the center of the tooth and clean out the canals to complete the root canal. You will have a temporary filling until the canals are sealed, and you can plan restorative treatment with your dentist. An antibiotic such as Amoxicillin may be necessary if pain and swelling is present. This will help control the spread of inflammation from the infected tooth.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.",I believe I will need a dentist to answer my question. Is there one available? My son lost two of his bottom teeth over month ago. Yesterday he came to show me his mouth. One of the spaces has bubbled and become dark blue however he is in no pain or discomfort. There is no sign on his perminent tooth . What could this be and how concerned should I be?,"Hi and welcome to Chat Doctor, After reading your history I suspect the lost teeth were primary or milk teeth, you did not mention your sons age so that we can predict the eruption of permanent teeth. I would suggest you to consult a dentist and get an x-ray done for the affected area. x-ray will show if there is a remnant of tooth left in the jaw that has lead to swelling and bluish discoloration or there is some infection or bubbling of the area is due to permanent tooth erupting. Accordingly treatment can be carried out. I hope this helps you, take care."

I cannot bend my big toe (which is the area where the pain originates, in the foot part just below my big toe) not because of the pain, but I physically cannot make it bend. It hurts to walk on the affected area but I can walk. I just cannot put weight on the big toe. It is painful with a mixture between dull and achy and suddenly sharp or throbbing. Though, I took a Vicodin and the pain is a lot better. The pain is more localized and the areas around it hurt less allowing me to put weight on those areas. Does this sound more like it could be a sprain since the pain medication helped with almost all of the pain aside from the milder pain I feel in the location of the bruise and swelling?",Dear patient You have injured your foot more so your great toe and possibility of fracture cannot be ruled out since pain is not relieved.  I would advise X-ray of involved foot anteroposterior and oblique views to confirm diagnosis.  If it shows fracture you need to consult expert orthopedic surgeon with report.  If its normal diagnosis is sprain and recommended treatment is rest for 2 weeks and tab diclofenac 50\u00a0mg twice a day for 5 days. All the best.

I can understand your concern. The pain which you are describing can't be meningitis as in this infection the child is quite sick and is unable to flex his neck.

My symptoms are, Hot spells especially at night, not assoiated with hot flashes, extream fatigue, pain in lower abdomine that travels any time any where, worse at night. Nausious all the time especially after eating, over weight and can t loose weight even though I eat almost nothing. I do eat healthy, veggies and fruit don t seam to trigger it any different than any other food. I have seen a few Drs and am to see a colon specialist on the 4th. My nodes started swelling last night making it unbearable to sleep. worse ones are in abdomine. Last time I went to the hospital they did basiclly nothing, the meds they gave me made me sick. There has to be a reason for this. No one seams to be able to or want to help. Any ideas?","Thanks for your query at Chat Doctor! I am Infectious Disease Specialist! I went through your query! There are various causes of lymphadenopathy (Viral, bacterial, tubercular infection), lymphoma, leukemia, etc. You need thorough examination and set of investigations(ZN stain from FNAC and cytology) to come to diagnosis whether viral, bacterial or tubercular in nature. In your case as you have evening rise it is likely \""Tubercular\"" in nature pulmonary or extra-pulmonary. But I recommend take a course of antibiotic for 2 weeks to see if it resolves before you get investigated for other causes. You will need antibiotic prescription. Happy to take more queries! You can also write a review for me. If you would like some more information, I will be happy to provide. Take care!"

I could barely walk that day but as it progressed it got better. jump to the next day and ever since, I ve had majopr pain in my neck to the point where I can t move it to my right, and I have pain in my shoulders and a tingling in my left hand. I looked it up myself and the symptoms seem to be that of a slipped disc, but could there be something else, and what should my next step be?","Hi you have guessed it right these symptoms are probably of a disc prolapse in the cervical region and if the pain extends to the hand then lower discs may be involved.be on rest take analgesics get a MRI of the cervical spine done do not lift any weight on neck, do not excessively move the neck use cervical pillow. Traction may be helpful, and some doctors prefer a short course of steroids to reduce edema and pain."

One other question, i had a Vasotemy Reversal and it was sucessful but my sperm count is low, i am taking medicine for 3 month with very little change in the sperm count, can you give me some advice.","HelloThanks for your query, based on the facts that you have posted it appears that you have undergone Vasectomy in the past and Vasectomy reversal very recently. Your semen analysis done very recently after reversal surgery is low. Normally there are very fewer chances of normal sperm count to be achieved, and it entirely depends upon the time gap between two surgeries as the anti sperm antibodies are formed after vasectomy which kill the sperms.

As mentioned by you about the symptoms, since it is vasculitis we need to have patience for the bodies mechanism to function. As treatment of choice is always directed towards the symptoms. Also, as the fatigue and pain is the factor, taking physical therapy will be advised as per me depending upon the vascular assessment. By passive movements of the limbs it will help to maintain the normal muscle property and metabolism of the cells. Also breathing exercises will help improve the oxygen in blood cells, which will delay the fatigue and pain. Usually, physiotherapy is a non-invasive and no side effects' therapy. Avoid performing massage to increase the symptoms. Also icing can help. You can discuss the same with your vascular surgeon. RegardsJay In Chat Doctor."
